Chrome Store assets
===================

Place store listing assets here before packaging or uploading:

- `screenshot-1.png` — 1280x800 recommended (main listing header)
- `screenshot-2.png` — 1280x800
- `promo-1.png` — 440x280 (optional promotional image)
- `feature-graphic.png` — 1024x500 (Firefox/Edge requirements vary)

Use the `tools/convert-icons.sh` script to generate icons first. Then add screenshots exported from a device or from `create-screenshots.html` in this folder.
